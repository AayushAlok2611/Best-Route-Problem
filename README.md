**Approach ->**

1. Enumerating Order States:
The code considers three states for each order:

Received: The order is received but not yet picked up.
Picked Up: The order is picked up from the restaurant.
Delivered: The order is delivered to the customer.

2. Recursive Backtracking:
The recursive function minTimeToDeliverAllOrders is the core of the algorithm. It explores all possible combinations of picking up and delivering orders. For each order, it considers the three states mentioned above.

3. Base Case:
The base case of the recursion is when all orders are delivered (allOrdersDelivered is true). In this case, the function returns 0.0 as there is no additional time needed.

4. Recursive Calls:
For each order, the function makes recursive calls for each of the three states:
Received State: The delivery executive moves to the restaurant, picks up the order, and updates the order state to "picked up."
Picked Up State: The delivery executive moves to the customer and delivers the order, updating the order state to "delivered."
Delivered State: No additional action is needed for this order.

5. Time Calculations:
The algorithm calculates the time for various actions, including:

Time to travel between locations based on the delivery executive's speed.
Waiting time if the executive arrives at the restaurant before the order is ready (max(0, prepTimeForOrder - timeWhenExecutiveReachesRestaurant)).
Accumulating the time taken for each action.

6. Backtracking:
After exploring each state for an order, the algorithm backtracks by restoring the state of the order and the delivery executive to their previous values. This allows the algorithm to explore other combinations.

7. Minimization:
The algorithm keeps track of the minimum time encountered during the recursive exploration. The overall result is the minimum time required to deliver all orders.

8. Initial Setup:
The main function initializes a DeliveryExecutive and sets its starting location. The actual orders are not provided in the code but should be populated with relevant data.

9. Output:
The minimum time required to deliver all orders is printed in the main function.

Note:
The code has placeholder implementations for functions like getDistanceBetweenTwoLocations and getTimeToMoveBetweenLocations. These functions should be implemented based on the actual logic to calculate distance and time.
The use of recursion and backtracking helps explore the entire state space, but it may lead to an exponential number of recursive calls, making it less efficient for a large number of orders. Consideration of optimization techniques like memoization or dynamic programming could be explored to improve efficiency.



**Time And Space complexity Analysis ->**

The time complexity of the provided recursive function minTimeToDeliverAllOrders can be analyzed in terms of the number of recursive calls and the work done in each call.

Let n be the number of orders that the DeliveryExecutive has in its order list.

The function explores all possible combinations of picking up and delivering orders. In the worst case, each order can be in one of three states: received, picked up, or delivered.

For each order, the function makes recursive calls for each state, leading to an exponential number of recursive calls.

Let's analyze the time complexity:

For each order, the function makes three recursive calls (one for each state: received, picked up, and delivered).
The function does a constant amount of work for each order, including calculations based on the locations and speeds.
The recursion depth is at most n because the function explores the state space for each order.
Therefore, the overall time complexity is exponential in terms of the number of orders: *O(3^n)*

The space complexity is the depth of the recursion stack -> *O(n)*


**Assumptions ->**

1) If we have 2 location , the function "getDistanceBetweenTwoLocations" will give us the distance between the 2 locations , the implementation details for this were not clear to me so I have left the function body blank. I have assumed that the time complexity for this operation is constant.
